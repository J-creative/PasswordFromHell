# Password From Hell

This site is live to play at [passwordfromhell.com](https://passwordfromhell.com/). I'd Recomend playing it first to get an idea of the password requirements. After that the relvant parts of the game can be found in [SignIn.js](src/SignIn.js). I've commented each section to help if you're looking to learn before you do I'd reccomend reading or little bit about regular expressions (regEx) or you won't understand most of it.

## The games creation

I was inspired to make this by the sites who despite holding no sensisitve information, are still arrogant enough to think their website needs you to come up with a 12 character password and update it every 6 months. 

The game itself was made in react using material ui. This is the style framework google uses so it allowed me to get thier exact sign in form as a template. Using react for this is really overkill but getting the sign in form looking absolutely perfect is essential for such a small project so I went for it.
